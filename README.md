#  Latin Companion Mac

Look up Latin words using [Whitaker's Words](http://archives.nd.edu/words.html). Very useful as a translation aid for Latin scholars. It also includes a cached search history so you can easily reference words you've already looked up.

This is a personal project I built for myself in college, and my first attempt to build a Mac app.
